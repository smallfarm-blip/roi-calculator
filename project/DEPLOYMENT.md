# Deployment Guide: GitHub + Netlify

This guide will help you deploy the E-commerce ROI Calculator to Netlify via GitHub.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Netlify account (free)
- Git installed on your computer

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name your repository (e.g., "ecommerce-roi-calculator")
5. Make it public or private (your choice)
6. **Don't** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these files)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these in your terminal:

```bash
# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Make your first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: E-commerce ROI Calculator"

# Add your GitHub repository as origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

## Step 3: Connect to Netlify

1. Go to [Netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign in
2. Click "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"
3. Choose "Deploy with GitHub"
4. Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account
5. Select your repository from the list
6. Configure build settings:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`
   - **Node version**: `18` (set in Environment variables if needed)
7. Click "Deploy site"

## Step 4: Configure Environment (if needed)

If you need to set environment variables:
1. In your Netlify dashboard, go to Site settings
2. Click "Environment variables"
3. Add any required variables

## Step 5: Custom Domain (Optional)

To use a custom domain:
1. In Netlify dashboard, go to "Domain settings"
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Follow the DNS configuration instructions

## Automatic Deployments

Once connected, Netlify will automatically deploy your site whenever you push changes to the main branch of your GitHub repository.

## Local Development

To run the project locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check that all dependencies are listed in `package.json`
- Ensure Node version compatibility
- Check build logs in Netlify dashboard

### Site Not Loading
- Verify the publish directory is set to `dist`
- Check that `netlify.toml` is in the root directory
- Ensure redirects are configured for SPA routing

### Updates Not Deploying
- Check that changes are pushed to the correct branch (usually `main`)
- Verify webhook is working in Netlify settings
- Check deploy logs for errors

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Netlify's deploy logs
2. Verify GitHub repository has the latest code
3. Ensure all files are committed and pushed
4. Check Netlify community forums for similar issues

## Files Added for Deployment

- `.gitignore` - Specifies which files Git should ignore
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration file
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - This deployment guide

The project is already configured with the necessary build scripts in `package.json`.
